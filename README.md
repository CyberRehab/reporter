CyberRehab is a Linux based gateway security solution for corporations and people who don’t like to be hacked. It’s like NATO on Internet, where an attack on one of us is an attack on all.

Our ambition is to make it profitable for ISPs to take cyber security seriously. We are not planning to hack back or do anything illegal, but nagging their ISP offering rehabilitation to poor ISPs addicted to cybercrime might also help – if we’re many enough. Read more on our future webpage.

CyberRehab gateway security solution comes as a iso (or what???) for the basic gateway server. Users can choose to install our server extension module or install the packages manually.
